			Variables and types

			The usefulness of the "Hello World" programs shown in the previous chapter is rather questionable.
			We had to write several lines of code, compile them, and then execute the resulting program,
			just to obtain the result of a simple sentence written on the screen.

			It certainly would have been much faster to type the output sentence ourselves.

			However, programming is not limited only to printing simple texts on the screen.
			In order to go a little further on and to become able to write programs that perform useful tasks that really save us work,
			we need to introduce the concept of variables.

			Let's imagine that I ask you to remember the number 5, and then I ask you to also memorize the number 2 at the same time.
			You have just stored two different values in your memory (5 and 2).
			Now, if I ask you to add 1 to the first number I said, you should be retaining the numbers 6 (that is 5+1) and 2 in your memory.
			Then we could, for example, subtract these values and obtain 4 as result.

			The whole process described above is a simile of what a computer can do with two variables.
			The same process can be expressed in C++ with the following set of statements:

				a = 5;
				b = 2;
				a = a + 1;
				result = a - b;

			Obviously, this is a very simple example, since we have only used two small integer values,
			but consider that your computer can store millions of numbers like these at the same time and conduct sophisticated mathematical operations with them.

			We can now define variable as a portion of memory to store a value.

			Each variable needs a name that identifies it and distinguishes it from the others.
			For example, in the previous code the variable names were a, b, and result,
			but we could have called the variables any names we could have come up with,
			as long as they were valid C++ identifiers.

			Identifiers

			A valid identifier is a sequence of one or more letters, digits, or underscore characters (_). Spaces,
			punctuation marks, and symbols cannot be part of an identifier. In addition, identifiers shall always begin with a letter.
			They can also begin with an underline character (_),
			but such identifiers are -on most cases- considered reserved for compiler-specific keywords or external identifiers,
			as well as identifiers containing two successive underscore characters anywhere.
			In no case can they begin with a digit.

			C++ uses a number of keywords to identify operations and data descriptions;
			therefore, identifiers created by a programmer cannot match these keywords.

			The standard reserved keywords that cannot be used for programmer created identifiers are:

				alignas, alignof, and, and_eq, asm, auto, bitand, bitor, bool, break, case, catch, char, char16_t, char32_t, class, compl,
				const, constexpr, const_cast, continue, decltype, default, delete, do, double, dynamic_cast, else, enum, explicit, export,
				extern, false, float, for, friend, goto, if, inline, int, long, mutable, namespace, new, noexcept, not, not_eq,
				nullptr, operator, or, or_eq, private, protected, public, register, reinterpret_cast, return, short, signed, sizeof,
				static, static_assert, static_cast, struct, switch, template, this, thread_local, throw, true, try, typedef, typeid,
				typename, union, unsigned, using, virtual, void, volatile, wchar_t, while, xor, xor_eq

			Specific compilers may also have additional specific reserved keywords.

			Very important: The C++ language is a "case sensitive" language.
			That means that an identifier written in capital letters is not equivalent to another one with the same name but written in small letters.
			Thus, for example, the RESULT variable is not the same as the result variable or the Result variable.
			These are three different identifiers identifiying three different variables.

		/*
			Fundamental data types

			The values of variables are stored somewhere in an unspecified location in the computer memory as zeros and ones.
			Our program does not need to know the exact location where a variable is stored; it can simply refer to it by its name.
			What the program needs to be aware of is the kind of data stored in the variable.
			It's not the same to store a simple integer as it is to store a letter or a large floating-point number;
			even though they are all represented using zeros and ones, they are not interpreted in the same way,
			and in many cases, they don't occupy the same amount of memory.

			Fundamental data types are basic types implemented directly by the language that represent the basic storage units supported natively by most systems.
			They can mainly be classified into:
			Character types:	They can represent a single character, such as 'A' or '$'.
								The most basic type is char, which is a one-byte character.
								Other types are also provided for wider characters.
			Numerical integer types:	They can store a whole number value, such as 7 or 1024.
										They exist in a variety of sizes, and can either be signed or unsigned,
										depending on whether they support negative values or not.
			Floating-point types:	They can represent real values, such as 3.14 or 0.01, with different levels of precision,
									depending on which of the three floating-point types is used.
			Boolean type:	The boolean type, known in C++ as bool, can only represent one of two states, true or false.


			Here is the complete list of fundamental types in C++:

				Group						Type names*				Notes on size / precision

				Character types				char					Exactly one byte in size. At least 8 bits.
											char16_t				Not smaller than char. At least 16 bits.
											char32_t				Not smaller than char16_t. At least 32 bits.
											wchar_t					Can represent the largest supported character set.
				Integer types (signed)		signed char				Same size as char. At least 8 bits.
											signed short int		Not smaller than char. At least 16 bits.
											signed int				Not smaller than short. At least 16 bits.
											signed long int			Not smaller than int. At least 32 bits.
											signed long long int	Not smaller than long. At least 64 bits.
				Integer types (unsigned)	unsigned char			(same size as their signed counterparts)
											unsigned short int
											unsigned int
											unsigned long int
											unsigned long long int
				Floating-point types		float
											double					Precision not less than float
											long double				Precision not less than double
				Boolean type				bool
				Void type					void					no storage
				Null pointer				decltype(nullptr)

			* The names of certain integer types can be abbreviated without their signed
			and int components - only the part not in italics is required to identify the type, the part in italics is optional.
			I.e., signed short int can be abbreviated as signed short, short int,
			or simply short; they all identify the same fundamental type.

			Within each of the groups above, the difference between types is only their size (i.e., how much they occupy in memory):
			the first type in each group is the smallest, and the last is the largest,
			with each type being at least as large as the one preceding it in the same group.
			Other than that, the types in a group have the same properties.

			Note in the panel above that other than char (which has a size of exactly one byte),
			none of the fundamental types has a standard size specified (but a minimum size, at most).
			Therefore, the type is not required (and in many cases is not) exactly this minimum size.
			This does not mean that these types are of an undetermined size, but that there is no standard size across all compilers and machines;
			each compiler implementation may specify the sizes for these types that fit the best the architecture where the program is going to run.
			This rather generic size specification for types gives the C++ language a lot of flexibility
			to be adapted to work optimally in all kinds of platforms, both present and future.

			Type sizes above are expressed in bits; the more bits a type has, the more distinct values it can represent,
			but at the same time, also consumes more space in memory:

			Type sizes above are expressed in bits; the more bits a type has,
			the more distinct values it can represent,
			but at the same time, also consumes more space in memory:

				Size	Unique representable values		Notes
				8-bit							256	=	2^8
				16-bit						 65,536	=	2^16
				32-bit				  4,294,967,296	=	2^32 (~4 billion)
				64-bit	 18,446,744,073,709,551,616	=	2^64 (~18 billion billion)


			For integer types, having more representable values means that the range of values they can represent is greater;
			for example, a 16-bit unsigned integer would be able to represent 65536 distinct values in the range 0 to 65535,
			while its signed counterpart would be able to represent, on most cases, values between -32768 and 32767.
			Note that the range of positive values is approximately halved in signed types compared to unsigned types,
			due to the fact that one of the 16 bits is used for the sign; this is a relatively modest difference in range,
			and seldom justifies the use of unsigned types based purely on the range of positive values they can represent.

			For floating-point types, the size affects their precision, by having more or less bits for their significant and exponent.

			If the size or precision of the type is not a concern, then char, int, and double are typically selected to represent characters,
			integers, and floating-point values, respectively.
			The other types in their respective groups are only used in very particular cases.

			The properties of fundamental types in a particular system
			and compiler implementation can be obtained by using the numeric_limits classes (see standard header <limits>).
			If for some reason, types of specific sizes are needed, the library defines certain fixed-size type aliases in header <cstdint>.

			The types described above (characters, integers, floating-point, and boolean) are collectively known as arithmetic types.
			But two additional fundamental types exist: void, which identifies the lack of type; and the type nullptr,
			which is a special type of pointer. Both types will be discussed further in a coming chapter about pointers.

			C++ supports a wide variety of types based on the fundamental types discussed above; these other types are known as compound data types,
			and are one of the main strengths of the C++ language. We will also see them in more detail in future chapters.

			Previously, IEEE 754-1985 introduced a standard for binary floating points,
			IEEE 854-1987 defined a standard for radix-independent floating points (binary / decimal)
			IEEE 754-2008 includes both binary and decimal.

			IEEE 754 standard definition
			The main items defined in IEEE 754 are as follows.

				* Arithmetic formats
				* Interchange formats
				* Rounding rules
				* Operations
				* Exception handling

			It also includes standards such as advanced exception handling and additional operations (trigonometric functions, etc.).


			- Arithmetic formats

			A floating point is expressed as an exponent representing the position of a decimal point and
			a mantissa representing a significant digit when expressing a real number.
			In addition to finite numbers, we have set standards for infinity and NaN.

				Basic format
					(-1)^s × c × b^q

			The expression for floating point is as above.

				s: Represents a sign (sign), where 0 represents +, and 1 represents -.
				c: Represents the mantissa (significand, fraction), expressed as a positive integer.
				   The range is limited by the precision.
				b: Indicates the base / radix, which is 2 or 10 in IEEE 754.
				   This means that each is represented as a binary number or a decimal number.
				q: represents the exponent and the exponent represents the position of the decimal point.

			For example, 1.2345 is expressed as the base number 10, as follows.

				1.2345 = (-1)^0 × 12345 × 10^-4

			By default, the value of each part is

				s: 0
				c: 12345
				b: 10
				q: -4

			In the actual representation, since the bit size of the significand and
			the exponent are different according to the precision defined by IEEE 754, the number of digits to be represented is different.

			NaN (not a number)
			IEEE 754 defines a special value in addition to the usual number.
			NaN is a symbol that indicates that the calculations failed due to incorrect inputs.
			The main situations in which NaN occurs are as follows.

				Operator			Conditions for generating NaN
				+					∞ + (-∞)
				×					0 × ∞
				/					0 / 0, ∞ / ∞
				REM					X REM 0, ∞ REM Y
				root				root(X) (when x < 0)
	
			The way to express NaN is as follows.

				* All bits in the exponent are filled with 1s.
				* The value of the mantissa should not be zero.
				* The sign does not make sense.
			
			There are two types: quiet NaN and signaling NaN.

			Quiet NaN
			Quiet NaN is responsible for continuing operations by returning a NaN without throwing an exception due to erroneous input.
			In the case of Quiet NaN, all bits in the mantissa are filled with 1s.

			Signaling NaN
			Signaling NaN indicates a case where an exception is raised during a wrong operation as opposed to a quiet NaN.
			Signaling NaN fills most of the mantissa bits with zeros and fills at least one bit with ones.

			infinity
			Infinity defines the value to represent when overflow occurs.
			This is because it is a more secure way than using the maximum number of expressions to be infinite.
			The way to express infinity is as follows.

				* All bits in the exponent are filled with 1s.
				* All bits in the mantissa are filled with zeros.
				* It is divided into positive infinity and negative infinity according to the sign.
				
			For example, 0 / 0 is NaN.
			However, dividing a nonzero number by 0 results in infinity, which is 1/0 = ∞ and -1 / 0 = -∞.
			IEEE 754 defines c / 0 = ± ∞ when c is not zero.
			At this point, the sign will follow the sign of c.
			For reference, if the sign bit is 0, it is positive infinity, and if 1, it is negative infinity.

			Zero signed
			IEEE 754 distinguishes between signed 0s.
			We have set the rule of -0 = +0 because we can produce uncertain results in operations like if (x == 0).
			The use of a signed 0 enables the expression 1 / -∞ <1 / + ∞.
			A method of expressing a signed 0 is as follows.

			All bits in the exponent are filled with zeros.
			All bits in the mantissa are also filled with zeros.
			It is divided into +0 and -0 depending on the sign.
			For reference, if the sign bit is 0, it is +0, and if it is 1, it is -1.


			- Exchange type

			IEEE 754 defines 32-, 64-, and 128-bit binary formats and 64- and 128-bit decimal formats by default.
			For reference, binary 32 format is called single precision and binary 64 format is called double precision.
			The main factors for each type are as follows. (sign bit is always 1 digit)

				Format name		Precision name			Base	Exponent	Significand		Exponent bias		Min Exponent	Max Exponent
				binary32		Single precision		2		8			23				2^7 - 1 = 127		-126			127
				binary64		Double precision		2		11			52				2^10 - 1 = 1023		-1022			1023
				binary128		Quadruple precision		2		15			112				2^14 - 1 = 16383	-16382			16383
				decimal64								10		10			16				398					-383			384
				decimal128								10		14			34				6176				-6143			6144

			For binary format, the number of digits is the same as the number of bits, but in case of decimal,
			it indicates the number of digits to represent.
			Also, the way to express decimal 64 and decimal 128 bits is slightly different.

			In addition, it defines binary 16, binary 256, and decimal 32.
			It also defines a format that extends the base format.
			The extended precision format specifies a lower bound on how much more bits to add in the standard format.	
			Major extensions include x86 extended double quotes.

			Format conversion (binary32)
			In order to represent an arbitrary real number as binary 75 (IEEE 754 standard, single precision), 
			the absolute value of the real number is converted into binary, and the values ​​corresponding to sign, exponent,
			and mantissa are summed up It can be expressed in position.	
			Basically, the following steps are taken.

				* First, the code part is represented by a bit in an arbitrary real number. (0 for +, 1 for -)
				* The absolute value is expressed in binary form.
				* Normalize processing to form arithmetic expressions.
				
					(-1)^s × c × b^q
				
				* In the above result, the remainder except the first 1 of the mantissa (c) is filled in the significand bit.
				  (At this point, fill in the missing part with zeros.)
				* The exponent part (q) is added to the sign bits by adding the bias value and then expressed in binary.
				
			For more information, see the examples below.

			Expression example
			Let's express arbitrary real number -12.375 in binary32 format.
			The bit structure of binary 32 is as shown in the table above, which requires the mantissa 23, the exponent 8, and the code 1.

				sign exponent                 significand
				[0]  [0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0] [0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0]
				31   30                   23  22                                                                0

			If the code part is represented by a bit in an arbitrary real number, the bit value of the sign is 1 since -12.375 is a negative number.
				
				sign exponent                 significand
				[1]  [0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0] [0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0]
				31   30                   23  22                                                                0

			Expressing the absolute value of 12.375 in binary is 1100.011.
			Note that when converting to binary,
			the integer part before the decimal point is represented by the remainders divided by the remainder being less than 2,
			and the decimal part after the decimal point is multiplied by 2 until the result is 1.0,
			and expressed as an integer part for each step.

			Now normalize the result.
			Normalization means processing the arithmetic expression so that the first digit of the mantissa (c) is 1.
			When normalization is performed, the mantissa part (c) is represented by the expression 1.xxxx.
			Normalization of the previous result is as follows.

				1.100011 × 2^3

			If the normalization is performed, the integer part of the mantissa is always 1, so it is omitted when expressing binary32.
			In the binary32 format, the mantissa is composed of 23 bits, but since the first 1 is omitted by the normalization operation, it actually represents 24 bits.
			It says that it uses the hidden bit (hidden bit).
			
			Now the expression of the mantissa is as follows.

				sign exponent                 significand
				[1]  [0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0] [1][0][0][0][1][1][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0]
				31   30                   23  22                                                                0

			In 1.10011, only the fractional part except the leading 1 is represented, and the remaining bits are filled with 0s.

			Now the index part is left. Since the exponent can be both positive and negative, a special way of expressing it is used. IEEE 754 expresses both positive and negative numbers using the bias expression.
			In the binary 32 format, the exponent is composed of 8 bits, with a minimum value of -126 and a maximum value of 127.
			Since 8 bits can represent 0 to 255, it divides it by half and expresses both positive and negative numbers.

				That is, bias + q = exponent.

			In this example, since q = 3, bias + q = 127 + 3 = 130.
			130 is expressed by binary method and is 10000010.
			Finally, the final exponent is filled in as binary32.

				sign exponent                 significand
				[1]  [1][0][0][0][0][0][0][1] [1][0][0][0][1][1][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0]
				31   30                   23  22                                                                0

			Denormalized (denormalized number)
			IEEE 754 has a special value, such as NaN, infinity, and so on.
			In the above expression example, binary32 is expressed through normalization.
			In this case, the bit value is filled out except for the leading one.
			In other words, all the numbers expressed by normalization can not but express the number 1.xx..xx because of the hidden bits.
			For example, 0.11 × 2^126 smaller than 1.00 × 2^126 can not be expressed because it is out of the expression range of exponent part.
			Also, this very small value can cause some formulas to fail.
			Thus, IEEE 754 addresses this by introducing denormalized numbers.
			The behavior with denormalized numbers is called gradual underflow.
			The manner of expressing the denormalized number is as follows.

				* All bits in the exponent are filled with zeros.
				* Expresses the values ​​of a sign and a sigificand.


			- Rounding rules

			In IEEE 754, floating-point operations (or conversions) round off to represent the closest value to the original value,
			rather than beyond the mantissa representation.
			IEEE 754 defines five types of rounding methods:

				Collect
				Round up is rounded up in the + ∞ direction.
				Therefore, if a negative number is directed toward 0, if the absolute value is used as a reference, the number is discarded.

					 -∞ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------> +∞
					-1.0 -0.9 -0.8 -0.7 -0.6 -0.5 -0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0
					  -1    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0 0   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1

				Round off
				Round down performs rounding down in the -∞ direction.
				Therefore, if it is a negative number, the number is rounded up if it is based on the absolute value.

					 -∞ <--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- +∞
					-1.0 -0.9 -0.8 -0.7 -0.6 -0.5 -0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0
					  -1   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1 0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   1

				Round to zero
				Round toward zero always selects the nearest number in the direction of 0 for rounding.
				If you look at the absolute value, the absolute value is smaller than or equal to the original value,
				and the largest number of the same value is selected.
				That is, the process is always discarded.

					 -∞ ------------------------------------------->   <---------------------------------- +∞
					-1.0 -0.9 -0.8 -0.7 -0.6 -0.5 -0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0
					  -1    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0 0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   1

				Round to the nearest, even close to the nearest
				Round to nearest is literally rounding to the nearest value.
				In IEEE 754, the closest value is classified into two.
				One is ties to even.
				If the closest value is 2 (for example 0.5, the closest value is 0 and 1), the last digit of the mantissa is even.
				round to nearest, and ties to even are also called banker's rounding,
				and the IEEE 754 standard provides a basic approach to rounding.

				                   X                      O                     O                  X           
					 -∞ <--------------------   ------------------->   <---------------   ---------------> +∞
					-1.0 -0.9 -0.8 -0.7 -0.6 -0.5 -0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0
					  -1   -1   -1   -1   -1    0    0    0    0    0 0   0   0   0   0   0   1   1   1   1   1

				round to nearest, and ties to even are directed to even if the closest value is 2,
				so the directionality of the arrow may vary as follows.

				                 O                  X                   X                  O
					 -∞ <---------------   ---------------->   <----------------   ---------------> +∞
					 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0
					   2   2   2   2   2   3   3   3   3   3   3   3   3   3   4   4   4   4   4   4   4

				Round the nearest side and move away from zero.
				Another way is to tie away from zero. This selects the largest value based on the absolute value when the closest value is two.

								  O                      X                     X                  O           
					 -∞ <--------------------   ------------------->   <---------------   ---------------> +∞
					-1.0 -0.9 -0.8 -0.7 -0.6 -0.5 -0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0
					  -1   -1   -1   -1   -1   -1    0    0    0    0 0   0   0   0   0   1   1   1   1   1   1


			- Operation
			
			In addition to floating point representation, IEEE 754 defines standards for arithmetic operations, conversions, and testing.
			In the case of arithmetic operations, the operation is first rounded to round to nearest (ties to even).
			It also provides criteria for power, power, sign, and so on.
			This is to ensure that the same results are always obtained between standards-compliant programs and to improve portability.


			- Exception handling

			IEEE 754 specifies that handlers should be used to handle exceptions in various situations.
			There are basically five exceptions.

				* Invalid operation
				  Occurs when an invalid argument is used in an operation, and returns NaN by default.

				* Division by zero (divide by zero)
			      This occurs when the operand is 0 and returns ±∞ by default.

			    * Overflow
			      It occurs when the value is out of the range after rounding, and returns ±∞ by default.

				* Underflow
			      It occurs when the value is too small after the rounding process and basically returns an unqualified number.
				  It usually occurs as inexact.

			    * Inexact
			      Occurs when the result of an operation is incorrect.
				  Inaccuracies are most often caused by rounding off nonzero numbers.
				  It basically returns the rounded result.
			      Also, one exception flag is allocated to each exception to determine the exception condition correctly.

			In addition, the decimal floating point is clamped (if the value to be expressed in the exponent is out of the range)
			and Rounded (rounded off when the number is truncated, if Rounded occurs but Inexact occurs if the nonzero number is truncated).

			Floating point conditions
			
			When programming, there are certain error condition that might arise from your code.
			If the compiler catches any compilation errors, it will stop compilation and tell you what and where the error is.
			The compiler also may issue a warning for certain constructs, which may or may not give you problems during runtime.

			Here are some floating point conditions that you as a programmer should be aware of when doing floating point arithmetic
			(any of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), namely  INF, IND, and NaN (QNAN and SNAN) conditions and errors.

			Concept of NaN, IND, INF and DEN

			Software developers deal with two primary data types everyday.
			We know that they are String and Numeric.
			When some data is said to be not-a-number, then for some developers, it could be a string.
			In fact, it is not!

			When we deal with algorithms that perform extensive numerical computation on floating point numbers,
			there come situation which produces a result that cannot be called number!

			This article is trying to give its reader a brief overview of below given numerical concepts using C++ code samples.

				* NaN
				* IND
				* INF
				* DEN


			Background

			I was involved in a project which required porting some Matlab image processing algorithms to C++.
			The Matlab algorithm had high intensity in computation.
			It has to deal with many floating point operations, each of which will be repeated for several thousand counts,
			until a specific condition is met.

			One of the most challenging requirements of the project was to produce floating point output that exactly matches the output of Matlab, using C++.
			Any mismatch in one digit of fractional part will produce an output that is quite different from that of Matlab output.

			During verification of Matlab to C++ ported code, it is found that at some point,
			certain double variables were holding strange numbers such as "1.#QNAN00000000000", "-1.#IND000000000000" etc. How did it happen?

			Matlab has a rich set of quiet-easy-to-use utility functions and operators. One such function is given below.

				Pixels(isnan(Pixels)) = 0 ;
			
			Above Matlab statement will iterate an array named Pixels and assign a value of 0 to each array position whose value is not-a-number.

			Since there was some need for haste to produce an output in C++, one statement such as the above was missed during the porting,
			from Matlab to C++ and the result was obvious.
			I was confronted with "strange" numbers such as "1.#QNAN00000000000"

				Output		Meaning
				1#INF		Positive infinity
				-1#INF		Negative infinity
				1#SNAN		Positive signaling NaN
				-1#SNAN		Negative signaling NaN
				1#QNAN		Positive quiet NaN
				-1#QNAN		Negative quiet NaN
				1#IND		Positive indefinite NaN
				-1#IND		Negative indefinite NaN

			The best way to avoid invalid floating point numbers are to prevent them happening in the first place.

			What happened was that invalid floating point values were introduced while calculating the angle between two vectors.
			The acos method calculate the angle, and it’s domain is [-1, 1].
			Due to rounding errors, the actual value passed to acos was slightly less or
			slightly above the domain, which resulted in an invalid number.

			The way we caught the error was to modify the vector3d-class and insert breakpoints

			Why is this happening ?

			This is a structural problem when converting 10 decimal to 2 decimal on a computer.

			Let's start with the expression of real numbers.

			Real numbers are expressed in two ways

				* Fixed Point (Integer . Fraction ) : 345.3978 (integer:345 . fraction:3978)

				* Floating Point (fraction ×exponent) : 10 decimal : 3.453978   × 10^3
									                      2 decimal : 1.01001101 ×  2^4

			Fixed Point is the way we normally use it.
			Floating Point can not be stored in 10 decimal form on computers
			Floating point use 2 decimal to store and use real numbers.

			The format for storing real numbers is as follows.

				* float
					sign       exponent                 fraction
					[ 1 bit ]  [        8 bit        ]  [                    23 bit                     ]
					31         30                   23  22											    0
				
				* double
					sign       exponent                 fraction
					[ 1 bit ]  [        11 bit       ]  [                    52 bit                     ]
					63         62                   53  52											    0

			float type stores real numbers in 4 bytes (32bit) of space.

			sign bit		: 1 bit, positive 0, negative 1
			exponent bit	: 8 bit, store the exponent plus 127
			fraction bit	: 23 bit, store fraction, do not save the first 1

			Declaration of variables

			C++ is a strongly-typed language, and requires every variable to be declared with its type before its first use.
			This informs the compiler the size to reserve in memory for the variable and how to interpret its value.
			The syntax to declare a new variable in C++ is straightforward:
			we simply write the type followed by the variable name (i.e., its identifier).
			For example:

				int a;
				float mynumber;

			These are two valid declarations of variables. The first one declares a variable of type int with the identifier a.
			The second one declares a variable of type float with the identifier mynumber.
			Once declared, the variables a and mynumber can be used within the rest of their scope in the program.
			If declaring more than one variable of the same type, they can all be declared in a single statement by separating their identifiers with commas.
			For example:

				int a, b, c;

			This declares three variables (a, b and c), all of them of type int, and has exactly the same meaning as:

				int a;
				int b;
				int c;

			To see what variable declarations look like in action within a program,
			let's have a look at the entire C++ code of the example about your mental memory proposed at the beginning of this chapter:

			In C++, there are three ways to initialize variables.
			They are all equivalent and are reminiscent of the evolution of the language over the years:

			The first one, known as c-like initialization (because it is inherited from the C language),
			consists of appending an equal sign followed by the value to which the variable is initialized:

			type identifier = initial_value;
			For example, to declare a variable of type int called x and initialize it to a value of zero from the same moment it is declared,
			we can write:

				int x = 0;

			A second method, known as constructor initialization (introduced by the C++ language),
			encloses the initial value between parentheses (()):

			type identifier (initial_value);
			For example:

				int x (0);

			All three ways of initializing variables are valid and equivalent in C++.

			Type deduction : auto and decltype

			When a new variable is initialized, the compiler can figure out what the type of the variable is automatically by the initializer.
			For this, it suffices to use auto as the type specifier for the variable:

				int foo = 0;
				auto bar = foo;  // the same as: int bar = foo;

			Here, bar is declared as having an auto type; therefore, the type of bar is the type of the value used to initialize it:
			in this case it uses the type of foo, which is int.

			Variables that are not initialized can also make use of type deduction with the decltype specifier:

				int foo = 0;
				decltype(foo) bar;  // the same as: int bar;

			Here, bar is declared as having the same type as foo.
			auto and decltype are powerful features recently added to the language.
			But the type deduction features they introduce are meant to be used either when the type cannot be obtained by other means
			or when using it improves code readability.
			The two examples above were likely neither of these use cases.
